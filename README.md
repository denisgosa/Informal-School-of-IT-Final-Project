# Personal-Projects

This is the final project I had to write for my C++ course graduation held by Informal School of IT in Timisoara.

The main objectives of the program were to write a piece of code that can hold information about Police Agents and the fines they apply to  undisciplined drivers.The program had to do the following:
- Add a new officer
- Delete an officer's record (along with all the fines that he applied)
- Add a new fine and atribute that to an existing officer from the list
- Show a specific officer's record of fines (search by officer's personal code)
- Show a specific driver's record (search by driver's name)
